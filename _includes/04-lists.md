-One of my favorite things
  -is nested lists
  -and the thing that makes nested lists better
    -is if I can furthe nest lists inside it
    -deeper and deeper I go
-especially if I can return to upper levels of list easily

1.Numbered lists are okay I guess
2.If things I'm dealing with are ordinal
  -and I can nest unordered lists inside them
    1.Nota bene: No whitespace is between list symbol and text in list formatting
